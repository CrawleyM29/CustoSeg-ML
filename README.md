# Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning in R
Using R-language, this project is to display Customer Segmentation Machine Learning to find our best customer. I will be using unsupervised learning and using clustering techniques to help a Mall to identify several segments of customers that will allow them to target the potential user base. To do this, we first need to explore the data and then create visuals to get to know the customers.

## Data Exploration
To gain insights, we need to know our dataset.  Displaying the first six rows of the dataset using the function head() and summary() function can help us take a look at what we will be working with. Lets take a look.
